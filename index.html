                  <li>Title: Head of Dog Food Sales</li>
                  <li>Description: With her good knowledge of both computers and dog food, Sally got a head function right away. She had to sell those tasty little brown chunks of vitamins and nutrients, and she was just fabulous. Brought great success to the company, but had to leave after a scandal with big loads of food missing. Roomers have it that Sally stole them, but it was never proven.</li>

                  <li>Title: Big Data Management of Cat Food Branch</li>
                  <li>Description: After moving to a different state, and leaving her scandal behind, Sally got into the Cat Food industry. She manages all data regarding cat food; where is it stored, where is it manufactured, what are the new recipes. She has been Employee of the Month for 2 years in a row now. Unfortunately, the Cat Food doesn't sell too good anymore, since all cats are getting sick. The recipes are well-tested, but somehow don't hold up in practice..</li>
